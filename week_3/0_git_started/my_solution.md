## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
 This command will add a file or files to be committed, but must be used multiple times to actually commit the file. It will not add ignored files.

#### branch
 A git branch is a pointer, generated when a commit is made. If there are multiple commits active, you can make, then switch between branches to manage seperate commits individually. The HEAD is a pointer that shows your current branch, like a variable.

#### checkout
switches your current branch, points head to the branch you specified

#### clone
downloads a copy of a remote repository to your local machine

#### commit
sets a file or files to the final stage of being made current with its respective repository. Requires a message.

#### fetch
adds changes FROM a remote repository to local machine requires git pull to complete. Preserves tags if files possible.

#### log
Lists activity such as commits and merges

#### merge
It is the action that git pull/push takes to make changes permanent, joining commits to existing files.

#### pull
merges from remote to local

#### push
merges from local to remote

#### reset
sets the current branch to a previous branch, basically git add but backwards for undoing commits

#### rm
removes a file or files from the working directory, unstaging them

#### status
shows where tracked files are in the staging/commit process

- Fetch changes ok
- Commit locally ok

## Release 5: Reflection

The lingo on the sites is never for people on the outside of understanding to this degree. i can use git for what i need so far and no more, so sifting through the pages of git instructions for something usable can be time consuming.
great resource overall, im sure itll be there when im ready for more.

## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Github seems like its much more useful than i can grasp currently. Clearly, it was designed for professional collaboration in mind, and more than anything its displaying how possible it is to stay in perpetual contact and communication with your teams.

so far to me: github is like cloud storage for code and development related files, with the ability to determine who can change what how how permanent those changes that they make to your code can be.

After some of the continuing struggles I'm having setting up and understanding git and git hub, my primary concern
is knowing files are in the right place/repository/folder. I have not located the unit1_projects folder i've read
about. My goal for the remainder of the week (which is about 11 hours) is to create the closest thing to what I percieve the requirements for the week's challenges to be, and link to the on the turn-in form with the best intentions and great hope that they are properly located. I had my into session friday with two others in my "accountability group", Brian and Justin. We introduced ourselves and became familiar more or less, after which questions were asked and eventually the instructor left us to our devices. I felt like i might have slightly "hogged the mic", but at the same time, i also felt like i helped catalyze conversation and informational exchange. I'm shy to seperate myself from the rest of the cohort should my speaking up set me apart from them in a negative, or positive way. I'd be ok with being seen as kind of an "organizer" as i have in years past socially. My code-fu needs to be some of the strongest in the group, so more practice will DEFINITELY be necessary..

Version control assists with the development process of code and code-related projects, allowing for several different "stages" or "states" of the same project to be saved and accessable throughout the development process. Its just the same as why i would use up all the available state save slots when gaming on an emulator, or quick saving every time im about to fight in skyrim etc; so i could go back in case the thing i was committing to was bogus for reasons known or unknown. For example, I could pay for information and then load the game back to before i paid. The only difference is that the concept of multiple snapshotting is applied practically, professionally, and across the internet to everyone at once instead of just me exploiting a computer's nature to get ahead or cheat at a game.

HTML seems to be as streamlined as it needs to be for what it seems to be being used for in my experience. If there is a better way, necessity will dictate its change and maybe ill be part of it!

nothing seems especially good or bad about it, its practical and no more complex than ruby so far.
Aha moments were minimal, the slideshow was nicely direct and simple.
any questions i had i threw at google prettymuch verbatim. "making an image a link in html" => search. several results, most of them more profesionally oriented and thus more complex and NEXT RESULT oh that was obvious. Usually its just the syntax that i need clarification on, like where to put tags.

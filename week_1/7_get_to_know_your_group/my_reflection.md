The greeting email I sent:

Cheers, everyone!

My turn! I'm Jared.

I've lived in the bay area my whole life since 1982, not counting the last 4 years I spent living in the Portland, OR area.
I'm crazy about music. I mostly listen to that darn electronic music, both faster and slower types. I also like to cook, as well as play chess, poker, munchkin, minecraft, and Dota 2.

As far as business/collaboration for projects and challenges, I'm willing to do google hangout and/or stypi. Whenever. I got not only the multi-modal learning style, but the abstract random thinking style. So basically I need to surround myself with as many different types of both teachers AND learners as possible. If its a weekend, I'd say I'm available to just camp it up in the same hangout with just audio enabled while we each type away at our own things and help each other. Unfortunately, my weekdays are pretty shot before the evening. I'm working 35-40 a week in Mountain View so I can pay rent in SF come june, I do not want to commute unless it helps more than just me. Regardless, I haven't aptly described how much I'm looking forward to working with all of you great sounding people!

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

From what i read, and from what i was told in the intro session; I am much more on pace than i anticipated. Everyone has different questions, and they are all worth listening to the answers. It becomes clearer to me that the idea behind the dbc approach is using the fact the everyone will have different questions to answer some of the ones that dont get asked. I said i felt behind, and was assured that it was good, that everyone feels behind, its part of the design.

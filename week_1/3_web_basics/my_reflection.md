I learned that 
1. There are servers that look up the IP address of each webpage, such that every www._blank_.com is just a nickname for that coresponding IP.
2. It is very expensive to own a domain name throughout the process without backing like corperate sponsorship.

I was stoked to see the web page live, proof that github pages are a clever medium across which to turn in assignments. Id say the closest to an aha moment i had in this process was when the repositories synced without a hitch for the first time, and i saw the page live at last. My conceptions about github were accurate, i just got off the path somehow without knowing how to get back on it; i returned to the very begining a few times when github and my local repos wouldnt sync, claiming i had multiple index.html files i coudnt locate in finder or online. I'm sure it will make trivial sense later when i am more fluent with github's exact capabilities and limitations.

## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

A repository, or "repo" on github is created in one of a few ways:
A repository may be created:
on github.com,
within the desktop app,
or through the terminal / command line.

By using either of the second two ways, the repo will need to be pushed online to be accessable by anyone else, as it was created locally and is therefore inconsistent with the online repository. This can be done with terminal commands as well, or through the app itself.


 Open source is essentially communism in programming, allowing anyone interested in making improvements (or finding weaknesses to exploit) access to the actual, operating (aka source) code for a project. I could see how the word utopia could be appliccable, since open collaboration must certainly have tremendous advantages. But also, it takes the humility to accept that once you release something, its no longer yours.

As far as AHA moments, the only thing to report so far was when i realized there are reflection files in each folder in the week 1 work. As long as i follow the instructions to a T and make sure everything goes through on the first try, i dont have issues that cause me to delete the brasschos.github.io repo again.

i found gitimmersion.com mildly helpful, but not nearly as helpful as doing things like repeatedly creating and deleting repos on github to see what happens between the two.(local and online)

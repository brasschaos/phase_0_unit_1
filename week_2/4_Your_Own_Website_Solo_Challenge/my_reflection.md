# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* 

* I learned a lot about how easy and difficult it is to adjust the placement of divs with different purposes. using images is reportedly easier than using background colors without a more fluent knowledge of the coloring methods like rgb and the #abcdef.

* If I knew exactly what to type such that there was nothing lost between my mind and the html, css, javascript and jquery to make it a reality, I could definitely create some slick, mindblowing designs.

* My process consisted of lating div framework with text, and expanding them both as the content grew. I hesitated to add more since it accomplished what i was after for the most part and i didnt want it to get too complicated.
* 
* I'd like a sleek menu that accordions out sideways then down displaying the content. Always on the lookout for a cooler background image that people will most likely not recognize.
*
* It was slightly difficult to implement my recent teaching, only since it was the first time they were being applied practically. The majority of my research was on technicalities like syntax and positioning to the point that it got the job i needed done.

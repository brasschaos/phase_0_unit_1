* # U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* % What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
& How will you combat that? 
$ What techniques will you try?
# What is your overall plan for Phase 0?


* %.   In complete honesty my greatest obstacle to managing my time perfectly is my desire to balance social interaction with both work and critical DBC time.

* &:   I will not combat my desire to be social. The time my subconscious spends chewing on coding problems while I drink beer and watch the sharks give up their playoff season is valuable indeed. The breaking of the repitition is critial as well, it allows the mind to breathe (like the work for 25 minutes/chill for 5 minutes idea).

* $:   Currently I'm liking that one guy in the reading's idea about making posts on forums etc more ridiculus and outlandish. Doing things that make you feel like YOU (which is very, very good for you) provide a feeling of comfort once you see that people not only will accept, but might actually enjoy when other people behave like that around them. When everyone needs to be rigid and hide themselves from each other, apprehnsion assumes control and dissolves potential comfort.

* #:   The thing i wanted to know the most was about the pace of phase 0, how much was being released for me to mentally integrate before more was released. In my time so far in phase 0, I'd say the difficulty is a bit inconsistant. Github was really intimidating, knowing its got all this awesome stuff that professionals are loving but are going to remain over my head for a WHILE. Last friday my app stopped being about to create a status list? whenever i tried to push, so im using the console by choice just in time for week 3 :)

# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

    Web standards will continue to do their job of keeping the development community more or less up to speed, unless the horizon of web developent holds a million different
    standards and we get all lost again like web standards were built to combat. I'm really into the <header> tags and such, organization is made much simpler.

    I see reset.css as a tool to check the bare organization of a page, because if it doesnt flow there it wont flow with make-up on.

I used firefox before i switched to chrome, because it was straightforward enough that i didnt have trouble negotiating my way to where i was trying to go. I never really noticed sites looking different unless i was using a mobile device.
I used various stack overflow pages that a closed once i was reminded of syntax etc, nothing outside of the slides and links provided. Practice does a better job until i want to do something im pretty sure i can technically accomplish with code but dont know how yet.

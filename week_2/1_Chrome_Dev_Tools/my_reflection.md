# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* 

* The DOM is the nexus of the css, javascript and html associated with their page. As far as what its trying to accomplish id say it oes a pretty good job for my purposes. It certinly gets compclicated in its navigation but with a good familiarity im sure its not that bad.
* omg wordpress so complicated, im not worthy. somebody knows what theyre doing.
* i enjoyed the chrome dev tools, it felt practical and yet like i knew what i was doing just by using it.
* AHA moment: so this is what javascript is for, in the console! console.log makes so much more sense now
* DOM didnt click aside from some sort of layout method until i saw the dev tools open and something i read said that was it. so it becamse something i beheld instead of a concept once i began manipulating elements and console logging.

# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

    Responsive web design is definitely a clever way to more completely immerse the user into the experience of the page. Smartphones and tablets have
    certainly made it necessary to develop pages with their formats in mind. As they continue to develop in size, shape, and add new accessability options, web design will continue to adapt to the demand for seamless experience between the two.

    Visualization is probably the biggest part of web design, with organization in a close second when it comes to user experience. Visually impaired people on the web would definitely benefit from pages of a vastly different design. Are there mice that like, vibrate or something when they interact with an element meant to provide feedback or that would otherwise respond visually like lighting up when hovered over? Touchscreen monitors with some sort of feedback or non-visual sensory response? The way adaptations to a lack of a major sensory input are made are usually brilliant. Design should definitely carve out a niche for visually impaired people on the web, like an add-on for chrome or something at least.

    The idea of how simple it is to accomplish things like jumping to a section continue to remind me that there have now been decades of people working to streamline or otherwise improve the design process. Its like walking into a kitchen you'll begin working in soon and inspecting the layout. Everything is where it is for a reason, and that reason definitely has to do with being(and staying) effecient and organized when it comes to crunch time. Nothing seems more complicated than it absolutely has to be.

    So far.

        For this section I didnt need any resources outside of what was provided in the readme. The results were simple to create and identify.
